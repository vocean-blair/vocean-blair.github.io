## Hi There! 

My name is Lara Dominguez. I am an ecologist in entomology and interspecies interactions in an urbanized world. 

As the child of teachers and a life-long educator, I consider outreach and science communication an integral part of the scientific process. I seek to incorporate outreach and educating in all of my future career opportunities.

In 2025, I graduated from Carleton College with a Bachelor's of Arts in Biology. 

I'm currently based at Smithsonian Tropical Research in Panamá, studying termite ecology with a focus in the predation responses and thermal tolerances of neotropical arboreal termites. My research is supported by the post-baccalaureate Global Sustainability Scholars RAMP-up fellowship and mentored by Dr. Dumas Galvéz.
