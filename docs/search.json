I am an ecologist in entomology and interspecies interactions in an urbanized world.\nAs the child of teachers and a life-long educator, I consider outreach and science communication an integral part of the scientific process. I seek to incorporate outreach and educating in all of my future career opportunities.\nIn 2025, I graduated from Carleton College with a Bachelor’s of Arts in Biology.\nI’m currently based at Smithsonian Tropical Research in Panamá, studying termite ecology with a focus in the predation responses and thermal tolerances of neotropical arboreal termites. My research is supported by the post-baccalaureate Global Sustainability Scholars RAMP-up fellowship and mentored by Dr. Dumas Galvéz."
